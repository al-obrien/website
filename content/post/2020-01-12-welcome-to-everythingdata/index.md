As the welcome post for the website I will take this the opportunity to go through some **W's**.

## **What** is everythingData?
**everythingData** is a contribution to the, aptly described, 'whitenoise' of data blogs and articles on the web. However, I strive to make the posts here more than whitenoise, perhaps even useful and informative, and if not that, at least mildly entertaining. For those who know of [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/), [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/tag/rblogs/), or [Medium](https://medium.com/), and the associated [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), the format here will be familiar to you, albeit with my own styling. As in the name, I have a strong passion and interest in anything and everything data related but that could make for a rather chaotic blog. To tame my enthusiam I focus on public health topics but when I cannot contain myself I may post tangents on additional data related topics in other fields of study.

## **Why** is it here?
The reason **everythingData** exists is rather drab and unoriginal and as such I will skip most of the details and boil it down to two points:
1. Understanding that writing a blog has benefits for continued growth and education for the author, not just the audience. I found David Robinson [summarized it rather well](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/). I tend to log my projects in notebooks, which I attribute to a vestigial habit from working in a laboratory for many years. I expected my handwriting would have improved after this amount of time and notetaking. It has not. And **everythingData** as a platform to publicly share projects will make deciphering my projects  easier retrospectively and, as an added benefit, maybe even help others as well.
1. Provide a shared resource on public health data and associated methods, a topic that I believe is underrepresented online. There are many innovative and interesting health-related topics beyond machine vision applied to medical imaging. Access to data is one limitating factor allowing some topics to overshadow others or perhaps epidemiologists prefer to publish in research journals and government documents. Whatever the reasons, there are many public health topics that can be explored and I hope this website can provide a reference for others on topics they may not readily find elsewhere.

## **Where** is it going?
As mentioned, I want to have efforts in the domain of healthcare and provide insight into the field. However, I also appreciate the new tools/techniques and other datasets and I often find myself trying dataset outside of my normal expertise, learning about a new topic, methods, and analysis. So, where I will likely provide a lot of focus on healthcare data, both in traditional and modern methodologies, I will likely have tangents on other topics. I beleive this is useful as often I find other domains have developed very cool tricks for their problems that often can be applied in new fields!

## **Who** is the author?
My name is Allen O'Brien and I am an infectious disease epidemiologist. My education and experience have taken me to several places but all have had *data* as a common denominator. Please see more details by visiting [here](/contact).

## Also... the **How**

I often found when looking through articles online, they often read more like a journal or were far too long to enjoy reading on one's phone. As such, I hope to break topics that deserve attention into manageable pieces, with hopefully allowing readers a start-to-finish read in a comfortable 5 to 10 minutes. Topics that demand more time and attenntion will be split so as to be enjoyed in series, and who does not enjoy a series, perhaps it may even promote a binge *reading* attitude here...

How did I come to make this website? I wanted something fast and simple, and static site generators, Hugo even decribes the [benefits](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/) of using them. BUt I may provide a more dedicated post in the future detailing the process, but I believe these have already been covered by a number of other resources, many of which I found invaluable during the process of launching this website. Here is a slim selection of the first that come to mind:

1. Alison Hill's [website](https://alison.rbind.io/) and associated [github](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill) page
1. [Hugo documentation](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs)
1. [Academic theme documentation](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/)
1. [blogdown - Creating Website with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill
1. Mike Dane's [webpage and videos on Hugo](www.mikedane.com)
1. Freely usable images by [Upsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

Now that the difficult part of launching and christening the website is complete (I had to crawl out tedious customization time vortex), the next post can be what we all care about anything and everything about data!
