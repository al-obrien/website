<h2>A Need for Speed</h2>
<p>R often receives (unfair) criticism of being slow. In some cases this is true but often this is simply due to how the code is written and which packages are being leveraged. The R language is fast when vectorized functions are used (e.g. <code>mean()</code>), which avoids coding <code>for</code> loops in R. However, sometimes a problem is simply easier to code and understand when written as a loop; this is especially the case when the loops are nested. Other problems, such as running Markov chains, cannot be easily performed with vectorized functions. Or perhaps you have a high standard for highly performant code and want to take the reigns.</p>
<p>This post is a kind reminder to myself that, in many scenarios, it is easy to implement C++ code via the {Rcpp} package for extra performance or to simply allow a <code>for</code> loop to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30240573/are-for-loops-evil-in-r">run free and without judgement</a>. To get started (on Windows) is straight forward and only requires the same tools that R needs when <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">installing packages from source</a>. The focus here will be on the inline coding capability of {Rcpp} using <code>cppFunction()</code>, which can be great for simple tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="example" class="section level2">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example may not have great practical utility, nor be it the most optimized, but it does a good job showcasing the similarities between raw R and code written with Rcpp.</p>
<p>Imagine for the moment you are a data analyst that has been provided a vector of data. You want to perform a selective operation based upon the values in this vector. The values above zero will undergo a square root, whereas those zero and below will be raised to the power of two and then square rooted. As a piece-wise function in math jargon, this looks like:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\sqrt{x} &amp; :  x &gt; 0 \\
\sqrt{x^2} &amp; : x \leq 0 \\
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>However, you are uncertain as to what coding approach is most efficient and want to test out some options. Before we start defining the functions we must first must load some packages and set the seed…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(9054)
library(Rcpp)
library(microbenchmark)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<div id="r-vectorized" class="section level3">
<h3>R vectorized</h3>
<p>Typically, to solve this problem in R you would dip into vectorized solutions, perhaps using indexing, base R’s <code>ifelse()</code>, or <code>fifelse()</code> from {data.table}. The drawback to the latter instances in this particular use-case are they may produce warnings, which we will suppress later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Indexing
r_vec &lt;- function(x) {
    out &lt;- vector(&#39;double&#39;, length(x))
    idx &lt;- x &gt; 0
    
    out[idx] &lt;- sqrt(x[idx])
    out[!idx] &lt;- sqrt(x[!idx]^2)
    out
}

# Base R ifelse
r_ifelse &lt;- function(x) {
  ifelse(x &gt; 0, sqrt(x), sqrt(x^2))
}

# {data.table} equivalent of ifelse but faster
r_fifelse &lt;- function(x) {
  data.table::fifelse(x &gt; 0, sqrt(x), sqrt(x^2))
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="r-loops" class="section level3">
<h3>R loops</h3>
<p>Perhaps, your brain works better using <code>for</code> loops. In base R this can be achieved quite simply by allocating a new vector and injecting the modified values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Slow R loop
r_loop &lt;- function(x) {
    out &lt;- vector(&#39;double&#39;, length(x))
    
    for(i in seq_along(x)) {
        if(x[i] &gt; 0) {
            out[i] &lt;- sqrt(x[i])
        } else {
            out[i] &lt;- sqrt(x[i]^2)
        }
    }
    return(out)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="rcpp" class="section level3">
<h3>Rcpp</h3>
<p>Now we leverage {Rcpp} via <code>cppFunction()</code> to return a function named <code>rcpp_loop</code>. If you squint, you will see this looks very similar to the <code>for</code> loop from base R. The number of lines of code is also very similar. There are however a couple main differences of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indexing starts at 0, not 1</li>
<li>Data requires a declared type (e.g. <code>NumericVector</code>)</li>
<li>Semicolons (;) must be used as a line terminator</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># Using C++ via Rcpp (function name: rcpp_loop)
Rcpp::cppFunction(&quot;
NumericVector rcpp_loop(NumericVector x) {

    int n = x.size(); // Size of input vector
    NumericVector out(n); // Create blank vector of equal size
    
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
        if(x[i] &gt; 0) {
            out[i] = sqrt(x[i]);
        } else {
            out[i] = sqrt(pow(x[i], 2.0));
        }
    }
    return out;
}&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="comparison" class="section level3">
<h3>Comparison</h3>
<p>To compare the various functions, we generate a vector of 100,000 numbers from -500 to 500. To ensure all the functions return the same values, we pass this vector into each function and compare the results. For speed comparisons, we run <code>microbenchmark</code> 250 times for each function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Test data
my_vec &lt;- runif(1e5, -500, 500)

# Check equality (returns content if all equal)
check_eq &lt;- Reduce(\(x, y) if(all.equal(x, y)) x else FALSE,
                   x = list(rcpp_loop(my_vec),
                            r_vec(my_vec),
                            suppressWarnings(r_ifelse(my_vec)),
                            suppressWarnings(r_fifelse(my_vec)),
                            r_loop(my_vec))
                   )

# Benchmark
cpp_benchmark &lt;- microbenchmark(rcpp = rcpp_loop(my_vec),
                                r_ifelse = suppressWarnings(r_ifelse(my_vec)),
                                r_fifelse = suppressWarnings(r_fifelse(my_vec)),
                                r_vec = r_vec(my_vec),
                                r_loop = r_loop(my_vec),
                                times = 250)

# Output results
print(cpp_benchmark, order = &#39;median&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>When sorted by the median run time across replications for each function we get a range from ~500 microseconds to ~8000 microseconds. Although the table is nice, it is easier to see the differences between replications and each function when presented in a plot.</p>

<p>The {Rcpp} coded <code>for</code> loop was the fastest, the vectorized R function and <code>datatable::fifelse()</code> performed similarly, and the base R loop performed the worst overall (on my system anyway!). Using {Rcpp} can definitely make code run quickly, perhaps <em>almost</em> as quick as this dog…</p>

<h2>End note</h2>
<p>{Rcpp} provides an avenue to improve performance without having to leave the R ecosystem completely. The package comes with a number of rich features that make coding C++ code within R easy for someone who is primarily an R user, although it is not without its challenges. This post really only scratches the surface of {Rcpp} capabilities but often this is all one will need to get the speed boost they are looking for.
